  - Data retrieved via authenticated API call
  - Loading states handled during API requests

### Task Updates
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want to** update task details  
**So that** I can maintain accurate task information

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - JWT is securely removed from storage
  - User redirected to login page after logout
  - All protected routes become inaccessible
  - Logout endpoint invalidates token on server-side

### Task Deletion
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want to** delete unneeded tasks  
**So that** I can keep my task list clean  

- **Scope**: Task lifecycle management and cleanup  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Delete operation removes task from database
  - UI updates immediately via optimistic deletion
  - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
  - Only allows deletion of user-owned tasks

### Visual Progress Tracking
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want to** see visual progress indicators  
**So that** I can understand task completion status  

- **Scope**: Visual feedback on task progress  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Progress bar shows ratio: `logged_time / estimate`
  - Visual indicator displayed on task cards
  - Handles edge cases (0 estimate, logged_time > estimate)
  - Updates dynamically when time is logged

### Containerization
**As a** developer  
**I want** Docker containers for all services  
**So that** deployment is consistent and reproducible  

- **Scope**: Development environment setup and service orchestration
